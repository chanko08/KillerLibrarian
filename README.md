It's time to get payback on those pesky library patrons!
In Killer Librarian, you're a disgruntled librarian that has decided that she's had enough of everyone in her library, and they need to go splat.

Since you don't have any weapons, you'll have to push bookshelves and explode computers to kill people.
Your job ends when you clear every section (12 levels) of this rather large library of patrons!

## Controls ##
You can use `WASD` to move yourself, and `space` to restart a level you got stuck in.
Xbox 360 controller support is also available, with the analog stick for movement and the `x` button for restart.

## The Code
The code is available on [github](https://github.com/chanko08/KillerLibrarian) with the MIT license.
To run the code from you need to have [Love2d](www.love2d.org) version 0.9.2 or greater (although greater hasn't been tested).
Then for Windows users, it's simply locate the `Love2d` executable and drag the git repository folder onto the executable.
For Linux users, provided that `Love2d` is on your path you can simply run `love /path/to/folder` and that will start the game.
